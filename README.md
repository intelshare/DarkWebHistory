**History of Darkweb**
                    By:PM_ME_YOUR_APPLAUSES on Dread

Before 2008: The Proto-Dark Web
The dark web was a loose concept. Anonymity networks like Tor existed for activists and journalists, but organized illicit trade was scattered and rudimentary. Despite this, there were several private darknet forums for drug sales and trades. These forums, mostly on the clearnet but requiring an invitation and login, were early predecessors to the marketplaces we recognize today. The recruitment of users to these forums occurred mainly through public clearnet drug and pharmacy discussion boards, highlighting the early stages of community formation that would later define the dark web's infrastructure. One of these forums, The Book Club, initially opened to the public to quickly build a userbase before transitioning to invitation-only. Some of these private forums transitioned to onion services between 2008 and 2011, marking the beginning of a more structured approach to anonymity and security in the digital underground.
2008: The Genesis of Potential

    October: Satoshi Nakamoto publishes the Bitcoin whitepaper.
    January: The Bitcoin network goes live with the mining of the genesis block.


Bitcoin was born, an untraceable digital currency, paired with Tor, setting the stage for what would become the dark web’s economic backbone. Early adopters saw potential where most saw chaos. During this foundational year, several private forums on the clearnet began operating, offering drug sales and trades to a select community. These forums required invitations and logins, making them precursors to the later, more structured darknet markets. Recruitment to these forums was primarily through public drug discussion boards, highlighting the early, covert network-building that would define the dark web's evolution.


2009: Groundwork and Experimentation

    January: The first Bitcoin transaction occurs between Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney.
    December: The first Bitcoin exchange, BitcoinMarket.com, is established.


Cryptographic enthusiasts began tinkering, envisioning hidden online marketplaces. Forums buzzed with theories, and early attempts at anonymous trade stumbled, yet each failure taught valuable lessons. The groundwork for the dark web's financial infrastructure was being laid, with Bitcoin gradually gaining attention among digital privacy advocates. This year marked important technical strides in the development of Bitcoin, setting the stage for its future role as the primary currency for darknet transactions.


2010: Approaching the Crucible

    May: The first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurs when Laszlo Hanyecz buys two pizzas for 10,000 BTC.
    June: The Silk Road prototype begins development.
    July: WikiLeaks begins accepting Bitcoin donations.
    2010 - 2012: The Farmers Market, a public darknet onion forum, operates after starting as a clearnet operation years before.
    2010: OVDB, a public darknet onion forum with vendors, is launched but is short-lived.


Feeder sites that rated drug vendors, online pharmacy forums, and blogs began to influence the landscape. Before the establishment of Silk Road, Bitcoin was not widely recognized or trusted for drug payments within these circles. Payment methods included centralized "digital gold currencies" like e-gold, Liberty Reserve, and Pecunix, as well as Western Union, Moneygram, and cash in mail. During this period, GreenDot MoneyPaks were also a popular payment method until regulatory changes made them unsuitable. Bitcoin's potential started to be discussed more widely, setting the stage for its future prominence. It was only with the advent of Silk Road that Bitcoin began to gain traction among darknet users, moving from a little-understood digital currency to a preferred method for conducting anonymous transactions on the dark web. The vision of a hidden, secure marketplace crystallized further. The dark web community’s experimentation hinted at the massive disruption on the horizon. Additionally, The Majestic Garden⚠️ forum became known in this environment, a semi-private platform that periodically opened its doors to new members. It fostered a community of psychonauts who preferred substances like LSD, DMT, MDMA, mushrooms, and weed. Operating without an escrow system, it relied entirely on trust among users, highlighting a unique facet of community building on the dark web.
2011: The Silk Road Revolution

    February: Ross Ulbricht launches Silk Road.
    June: Gawker publishes an article about Silk Road, bringing it widespread attention.
    November: Black Market Reloaded (BMR) is launched by a pseudonymous operator known as "Backopy."
    August: Bitcoin value reaches parity with the US dollar.
    2011 - 2013: Black Market and Black Market Reloaded become prominent dark web marketplaces.


Ross Ulbricht launched Silk Road, the first true dark web marketplace. Leveraging Tor and Bitcoin, it offered a haven for anonymous trade. Silk Road’s success turned the abstract into reality, igniting the dark web economy. Meanwhile, Black Market Reloaded (BMR) also began to gain traction as an alternative marketplace. In this pivotal year, the broader potential of Bitcoin was realized within the underground economy, with earlier discussions on private forums paving the way for its adoption in high-profile platforms like Silk Road.
2012: Flourishing in the Shadows

    April: Silk Road’s user base expands exponentially.
    June: FBI and DEA begin active investigations into Silk Road.
    November: The U.S. Senate holds hearings on Bitcoin and Silk Road.


Silk Road thrived, inspiring a proliferation of marketplaces. The dark web ecosystem expanded, becoming more sophisticated. LE, slow to catch on, struggled to keep up with the digital hydra.
2013: The Fall of a Titan

    September: BMR experiences a significant data breach, but the marketplace remains operational.
    October 1: The FBI takes down Silk Road, arresting Ross Ulbricht in San Francisco.

    November: Bitcoin value surges past $1,000.
    2013: Atlantis, the third ever modern darknet market, ends in an exit scam.


The FBI took down Silk Road, capturing Ulbricht. Yet, the hydra sprouted new heads—Silk Road 2.0 and others emerged. Black Market Reloaded saw increased user activity, despite security challenges. The dark web community, resilient and undeterred, adapted swiftly.
2014: Operation Onymous and Resilience

    February: The first known arrest of a Silk Road 2.0 vendor.
    February: BMR returns briefly, but its operator "Backopy" permanently shuts it down due to security concerns.
    November: Operation Onymous leads to the seizure of over 400 hidden services, including Silk Road 2.0.
    November: The arrest of Blake Benthall, the alleged operator of Silk Road 2.0.


Operation Onymous saw global LE seize several marketplaces. Yet, the dark web proved antifragile. Silk Road 2.0’s fall led to the rise of AlphaBay and other robust platforms. The closure of BMR marked the end of an era, but it also signaled the community's ongoing adaptability and resilience.

AlphaBay ascended, but Evolution’s infamous exit scam in March underscored the inherent risks. New contenders like Nucleus and Dream Market filled the void, embodying the dark web’s relentless dynamism. Agora's exit in August marked a significant moment, as it voluntarily shut down to prioritize users' safety, setting a precedent for responsible operation in the dark web ecosystem. Hydra Market becomes a significant player in the dark web landscape, offering not only illegal drugs but also a variety of financial services that facilitate money laundering and the exchange between cryptocurrency and Russian rubles. Its unique offerings help it stand out among other darknet markets.

    2018: Outlaw Market and Middle Earth Market gain attention, contributing to the evolving darknet landscape.


Dream Market led amidst instability. New marketplaces like Wall Street and Point rose. LE’s persistent raids were met with the dark web’s relentless innovation and decentralization efforts. The crackdown on /r/darknetmarkets dispersed the community, but the emergence of Dread offered a new platform for users to reconnect and share information. Despite the setback, the community's resilience and adaptability shone through, maintaining the dark web's vibrant and dynamic nature.

Decentralization surged with platforms like OpenBazaar gaining traction. Privacy coins like Monero became standard. Despite Operation SpecTor II, the dark web community’s innovation persisted. The end of Hydra's long run as the dominant force on the dark web, sparked conflicts over the Russian darknet drug markets due to its closure.
